## Inspiration
My inspiration was the traditional game of hangman which we used to play at school. The game was simple yet engaging. It had a strong call to action and a small learning curve. I modified the game to make it more interesting as well as fun for all age groups.

## What it does
The goal is to guess the word. You have 5 shields at the start of the game. You then select letters that you think the word might have. Wrong guesses reduce your shields. The game ends when you have 0 shields left or when you have correctly guessed the word.

There is an option to get a hint, which would reduce your earned XP by half if you finally win.

Based on the tries it took to guess the word, you are awarded XP. Gaining XP allows you to level up and unlock more shields and a higher score multiplier. A leaderboard keeps track of all users' XP and allows users to compete with others.

## How I built it
I used Devvit Blocks as my UI framework and utilized Redis as my database.

## What's next for Word Battle
- Implementing different game modes for variety.
- Optimizing gameplay for mobile phones
- Improving the hint system to make it more dynamic.
- Introducing achievements and badges for milestones.
- Expanding the leaderboard with more ranking features.
- Adding more retro arcade themes
